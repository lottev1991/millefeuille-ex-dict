# Extended Dictionary for Millefeuille Voicebanks
This dictionary was created for Millefeuille voicebanks for DiffSinger. It adds things like liaison (by adding number suffixes), some fixed pronunciations, etc.
The default phoneme set is taken from Millefeuille but you're free to edit it to fit your voicebank wherever necessary.
Apologies for the size; I already cut down on a lot, believe it or not.

You're free to include this dictionary with your own voicebanks, just credit me (Lotte V) and Mim.
You don't even have to use it for DiffSinger voicebanks, you can also use it for UTAU etc.

This dictionary was adapted from the [OpenUtau French Dictionary](https://github.com/mmemim/OpenUTAU-French-Dictionary) made by Mim. It's not the full dictionary; it only includes the necessary words.

## How to install/use the dsdict
- Copy over the ``dsdict-fr.yaml`` file into your voicebank's ``dsdur`` folder.
- Now you can use it with the Millefeuille phonemizer (currently not available in upstream OpenUtau but included with most Millefeuille-compatible voicebanks).

If there are any inaccuracies in the dict, feel free to open an issue in the Issues tab above, or you can submit a pull request with corrections.
